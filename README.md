Welcome to my **[project](https://github.com/aliaksparkh/Coursera-EDA/blob/main/project_coursera.ipynb)** ! 
## Project Description
This project aims to analyze Coursera's course offerings, focusing on understanding the distribution of course ratings and student enrollments. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter notebook, and the insights gained can help identify trends and areas for improvement in the course offerings. The dataset used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset/data) . Exploratory data analysis has been performed in **VSCode**. 


## Project structure  
1. **Data Preparation and Overview:**  
The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps, including:  
- Removal of unnecessary columns.
- Checking for  duplicates.
- Conversion of string data to numerical values, particularly in the course_students_enrolled column.
- Normalization of numerical data using Box-Cox transformation.
- Identification of outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
The exploratory data analysis covered the following areas:  
- Course Ratings Estimations: Evaluated the distribution and central tendency of course ratings.
- Enrollment Analysis: Analyzed student enrollment numbers across different courses.
- Course Difficulty Levels: Assessed the distribution of courses based on difficulty, with a focus on beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.
- Relationships Between Numerical Columns: Investigated correlations between key numerical variables, such as course ratings and student enrollment.
- Course and Organization Popularity: Analyzed the popularity of courses and the institutions offering them, identifying top contributors and high-performing courses.
- Visualizations: Utilized various plots (histograms, boxplots, etc.) to visually explore the data and support findings.
3. **Conclusions.**
